            <p class="sectionSubTag">SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
                SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is used for storing and managing data in relational database management system (RDMS).
It is a standard language for Relational Database System. It enables a user to create, read, update and delete relational databases and tables.
                What is SQL?
                SQL stands for Structured Query Language
                SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
                SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
                What Can SQL do?
                SQL can execute queries against a database
                SQL can retrieve data from a database
                SQL can insert records in a database
                SQL can update records in a database
                SQL can delete records from a database
                SQL can create new databases
                SQL can create new tables in a database
                SQL can create stored procedures in a database
                SQL can create views in a database
                SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views</p>

                SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements.PL/SQL is a procedural extension of SQL, making it extremely simple to write procedural code that includes SQL as if it were a single language. This article gives a brief overview of some of the important points you should consider when first trying to learn PL/SQL.


                PL/SQL stands for procedural language; structured query language is known to be a block structured language. This was developed by Oracle corporation in the year 1980s. It is the Oracle corporationâ€™s extension for SQL and also the relational database. This is also available in Oracle Database since version 7 which stores procedures, functions, packages, triggers. Times Ten in-memory database since the version 11.2.1 and also IBM DB 2 since the version 9.7. it is said that the Oracle corporation usually uses PL/SQL functionality with the different successive releases of each oracle database.

                The PL/SQL language also includes procedural language elements like conditions and loops. PL/SQL allows declarations of constants and also variables of those types and also triggers and also exception handling .  .

            <p class="sectionSubTag">INTRODUCTION:
                A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.
                
                Some key features of a DBMS:
                
                Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for searching and querying the data.
                Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each other.
                Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.
                Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the data in the event of a system failure.
                DBMS can be classified into two types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational Database Management System
                RDBMS: Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data is related to each other through primary and foreign keys.
